					Eagle Scout Project
				</h2>
      	<p>
        	I obtained the rank of Eagle Scout from the Boy Scouts of America in 2011. For my Eagle Scouts
          project I contacted a after school program at my high school called Coastal School Ministries
          to see if there was anything they were in need of. The program met in a building across the 
          road from the high school. To get to the building students would have to cross the road and walk
          on a narrow shoulder of the road which was on a busy road. My project focused on making the trip
          safer for the students and to also provide a place outdoors for students to go to study or sit
          and socialize.         
      	</p>

        </ul>
				
        <p>
          I contacted local buisnesses and had all the required materials donated. 74 Lumber and a constructiondonated
          company called AmeriBuilt donated all the lumber needed for the project, Blue Max trucking donated the
          mulch that was required, and through various monetary donations I was able to purchase the hardware
          that was required for the project. I recruited students from the high school and some fellow boy scouts
          to help complete the service project.
        </p>
        <p>
          First we cut out a path through the woods that separated the building from the road to provide and
          more direct route for the students to take. Once the path was cleared out we built a pathway from
          landscape ties and mulch that went from the road directly to the entrance of the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then we began work on the sitting area that surrounded the oak tree that was in the yard infront of
          the building. I designed the benches for the sitting area so that there was not a hidden area under
          the bench that could house wasps, making it safer for students to spend time there. Once a border 
          was built around the sitting area it was filled in with mulch to cover any roots sticking up from
          the tree that could trip students that walked in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was some left over much so we spread out the mulch in the flower beds that surrounded the 
          building to help beautify the area.
